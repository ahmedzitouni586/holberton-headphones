# Implement a design from scratch

## Description

Implementing a design from scratch is funny and challenging, because you don't have many instrcutions and you are free to use the way yo want to impmlement the design, the only goal i have to acheive is to create a UI similar to yhe designer file.

## Requirements

- not allowed to import external CSS framework (like Bootstrap)
- not allowed to use javascript

## Tech && Tools

HTML and CSS are all i need to use in this project, it seems easy but in fact it's challenging and tricky because building a complex and responsive UI may require a deep undrestanding many concepts CSS like media querry, CSS variables, respecting the priority of CSS selectors,.. and of course we can't forget about the accessibilty where using semantic HTML elements is so important and choosing the colors and the font-size carefully
